test
- Training.py: It is used to train and generate the pre-trained model in the source domain and the target model in the target domain. There are instructions on how to generate the two models in the source code (can run in both CPU and GPU environments).
- Prediction.py: Used to make predictions on the model. 
- B.subtilis, D.melanogaster, E.coli, S.cerevisiae: Promoter and non-promoter sequence files for the four organisms. 
- test.txt: The promoter sequence used for prediction (the sequence format is fasta format).
- test folder: The one-hot encoding matrix generated by the promoters in the test.txt.
- class_indices.json: Category labels. 
- promoter.pth: The Resnet-18 model obtained by pre-training with Bacillus subtilis (this model is obtained by training in the CPU environment, if you are using GPU, you need to retrain a new model in GPU).
